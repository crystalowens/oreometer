#Printing Instructions

Designs were made in Autodesk Fusion 360 and printed out of PLA using a Creality Ender 3. Parts were sliced with Cura using a 0.3mm layer height, 20% infill, 210 C extruder temperature, and 55 C bed temperature, and printed with supports for the base halves, Oreo clamps, and penny castles.

This is an example layout in Cura to print one large penny castle and oreo base half. The gray box around the penny tower is a support blocker that prevents supports from being generated in all the windows (for ease of removal). But it's not necessary for printing quality.

The full printed design has a two-part front clamp, two-part back clamp, two penny castles, a two-part base, a bolt, and a nut, assembled as shown. Additional items are rubber bands (we used Advantage Rubber Bands #64 with dimensions 3 1/2 x 1/4 in) and pennies (~2.5 g each) or dimes (~1 g each) to fill one of the penny castles. 



#Tutorial on Using the Oreometer

Tutorial: A brief guide is included with suggested questions and activities to use the Oreometer for educational use.  
Design file set: Complete files are included to print a full Oreometer including .stl file format to be directly printable and .step file format to allow import and manipulation in most other CAD software. 

**Learning Objectives
**
•	Be able to define rheology and what it is used for 
•	Understand and be able to measure failure stress for soft solids
•	Be able to explain why torque may be different for different cookies but material stress is the same 
•	Be able to define adhesive and cohesive failure and explain the difference
•	Be able to make your own measurements at home and understand the results

**Background**

Torque is a measure of how much “twist” you apply around a point. Shear stress is the stress in the material in response to this torque and can be calculated by considering the different geometric factors. For example, a disk with small radius and a disk with large radius, made from the same material, will deform with the same shear stress, but the torque will be much greater for the larger disk. 
Rheology is the study of this material deformation for soft solids including creams, cheeses, and more, and a rheometer is the machine we use in a laboratory to measure this property, which is characterized as viscosity (for simple fluids) or rheology (for complex fluids). 
Oreos consist of two wafers with creme sandwiched in between. The creme-wafer interface is an adhesive contact since it is between two different materials. It is not a chemical bond, but a physical interface. The interfaces within the creme are cohesive since they are physical contact within the same material. If the Oreo breaks between the creme and wafer (a clean break), this is adhesive failure, whereas if the Oreo breaks so that creme is on both wafers, this is cohesive failure.

**Introduction**

“Frugal science” is a method of making high-tech but low-cost equipment for scientific measurements outside of research labs. Rheometers and other lab equipment are typically very expensive, over USD$100,000, but our 3D printed Oreo twister (which we will call the “Oreometer”) provides a simple, cheap way to study the same basic fluid properties. 

**Materials**

One box of Oreos (any type)
100 Pennies
2 Rubber bands
Printed parts from CAD files

**Preparation of Printed Parts
**
If a 3D printer isn’t available, parts could be printed at a local makerspace, in a local school or library that has a 3D printer, or a company

**Device Construction

Tutorial Figure: Labeled components of the Oreometer, and 
suggested rubber band configuration for clamping the Oreo

**Procedure: 
**
1.	Load Oreo into clamps using the suggested rubber band configuration or a configuration of your choosing. Keep in mind that there are two types of clamp halves: front clamp and back clamp. A front clamp has a slot on the side for a penny castle whereas a back clamp does not. Be sure to place clamps of the same type together. 
What do different rubber band patterns on the clamps do? Can you make one that is too tight? Too loose? 
2.	Load the clamped Oreo onto the two base halves (which are identical) and adjust the spacing using the nut and bolt. Twist the bolt clockwise until the base halves are close enough to keep the clamps from falling out, but not so close that they squeeze the clamps.
Why shouldn’t the base halves be moved so close together that they squeeze the clamps?
3.	Place the two penny castles into the slots located on the sides of the front clamp. 
Why are there two penny castles?
4.	Start inserting pennies into one of the penny castles until the Oreo twists apart. For easy counting, the windows on the outside of the penny castle are each 5 pennies tall. Below the center of the front clamp, there are tick marks to indicate whether the Oreo has begun to twist. The tick marks are spaced 9° apart, or 1/40th of a revolution.
Before failure, how much does the Oreo rotate, if at all? After failure, is the creme split evenly onto both wafers or does one wafer have more creme than the other?
5.	Record the number of pennies required to cause the Oreo to twist apart. Unclamp the broken Oreo and test out several more Oreos.
What was the maximum and minimum number of pennies required to twist an Oreo? What was the average number of pennies? Given that the mass of a penny is 2.5 grams and the arm length of the Oreometer is 90 mm, what torque and stress does this correspond to?
•	Extra 1: See if you can get the Oreo to twist by letting pennies sit in the penny castle for an extended time. This phenomenon is known as delayed yielding. Record the number of pennies and time it took for the Oreo to twist.
•	Extra 2: Test out stale, heated, or frozen Oreos. What effect does this have on the number or pennies required to twist the Oreos? How is the creme distributed on the Oreos?
•	Extra 3: Test out different Oreo variations such as mint or Double Stuf or even other cookies of similar shape. How many pennies are required now? Is the creme distribution affected?

**Observation and Results
**
Normal Oreos take around 30-60 pennies to break. However, Oreos that have been heated, chilled, or become stale will likely require more or fewer less pennies than this. It is common to see clean breaks (adhesive failure profiles). This is likely due to the way the Oreos were manufactured, where the creme bonds weakly with one of the wafers. Oftentimes, within an Oreo box most of the weak wafer-creme bonds will be on the same side for all the Oreos.
